'''Retrieve a web page element from a BeautifulSoup object by calling the select() method and passing a string of a CSS selector for the element. Selectors are like regular expressions.

The select() method returns a list of Tag objects, which is how Beautiful Soup represents an HTML element. The list will contain 1 Tag  object for every match in the BeautifulSoup objectâ€™s HTML. Tag values can be passed to the str() function to show the HTML tags they represent.

Tag values also have an attrs attribute that shows all the HTML attributes of the tag as a dictionary.
